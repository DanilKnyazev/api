      "service_type": {
        "id": "API_UNLIMITED",
        "name": "Access to the API HH"
      },
      "activated_at": "2018-02-01T12:00:00+0300",
      "expires_at": "2019-01-31T12:00:00+0300",
      "balance": null
    },
    {
      "id": "12345680",
      "service_type": {
        "id": "API_LIMITED",
        "name": "The package of requests to the API HH"
      },
      "activated_at": "2019-02-01T12:00:00+0300",

      "balance": {
        "actual": 10000,

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each enabled service is displayed as a separate object in the `items` array, 
even if there are multiple enabled services of the same type.

activated_at | string | Service activation time (according to [ISO 8601](../general.md#date-format) accurate to second `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hhmm`)
expires_at | string | Service expiration time (according to [ISO 8601](../general.md#date-format) accurate to second `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hhmm`)
balance | object, null | [Balance values](#balance)
